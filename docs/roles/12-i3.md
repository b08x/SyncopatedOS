## i3

#### Initial Design and Environment Support:



The i3 role contains configuration related to installing and setting up the i3 window manager.

The role directory follows the standard structure:

- README.md - Documentation on what the role does.

- defaults/main.yml - Default variable values.

- handlers/main.yml - Role handlers.

- tasks/main.yml - Main tasks file including imports for any additional tasks files.

- templates/ - Template files for configuration.

- vars/main.yml - Role variables.


Some specific content and tasks handled by the i3 role include:

- Installing the i3 package
- Generating and configuring i3 configuration files from templates
- Setting up i3 autostart applications
- Configuring i3 window bindings and workspaces
- Managing i3 service - enabling, starting, restarting
- Importing additional tasks files for areas like i3bar, i3blocks, etc.

So in summary, it provides all the configuration necesssary to install, set up and manage i3 as the window manager through Ansible in a repeatable way. This includes package installation, configuration generation and ongoing service management.

The role is self-contained to focus specifically on i3 tasks while following best practices for role structure and documentation.
