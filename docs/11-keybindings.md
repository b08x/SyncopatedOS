# keybindings

/ask One optimization I'd like to make relates to keybindings. Keybindings can be set in i3, sxhkd and input-remapper. use creative imagination to generate some possible solutions to consolidating keybinding variables



Here are some suggestions for consolidating keybinding variables across roles:

Create a shared "keybindings" role
This role defines all keybinding variables and common tasks
Other roles like desktop, i3 import the keybindings role
keybindings role templates generate configs for each WM/tool
Use a common keybinding variables file
Create roles/keybindings/vars/main.yml
Define types like modmaps, keys, bindings
Other roles import this vars file
Create a keybinding configuration data structure
Define keymaps, bindings as a YAML structure
Render templates from a shared keybinds config
Centralize configuration templates
Move keybinding templates to keybindings/templates
Other roles reference templates from there
Introduce conditionals
Roles check if keybindings required
Apply bindings role conditionally
This avoids duplication across roles and ensures consistency. A shared keybindings role/vars approach modularizes and centralizes configuration in one place while keeping per-WM tasks separated.Template and variable references promote reusability. Conditionals prevent unnecessary tasks.

/ask Where are the keybinding configurations located in the repo?



The keybinding configurations in the Ansible repo are located in several places:

/syncopatedIaC/roles/i3/templates/home/.config/rofi-i3-keybindings

This script displays i3 keybindings in rofi by parsing the i3 config.

/syncopatedIaC/roles/i3/templates/home/.config/i3/config.j2

The main i3 configuration file template, which will contain keybindings.

/syncopatedIaC/roles/sway/files/usr/share/sway/scripts/sbdp.py

A Python script for parsing Sway bindings and configs.

/syncopatedIaC/roles/x/tasks/sxhkd.yml

Tasks for generating and installing the sxhkd keybinding config.

/syncopatedIaC/roles/desktop/defaults/main.yml

Defines variables for applications to import like input-remapper.

/syncopatedIaC/roles/desktop/tasks/input-remapper.yml

Tasks for configuring input-remapper keys.

So in summary, keybindings are defined:

As templates rendered to config files
Via scripts that parse configs
By variables for other roles to reference
In tasks files for applications that support keys
The templates and variables approach allows defining bindings centrally while keeping per-WM/app configuration modular across roles.


/ask Is there a specific task or workflow that involves keybindings in the repo?

Yes, there is a specific workflow involving keybindings in the Ansible repo:

Keybinding variables are defined across various roles:

i3 role templates render i3 config from variables
Sway role script parses configs using variables
X role imports sxhkd task using variables
Desktop role imports input-remapper using variables
During playbook runs, these roles are applied in order:

Base role establishes base system
X role sets up X environment
Desktop role sets up DE and WMs
i3/Sway roles configure specific WMs
The roles generate and install keybinding configs:

i3 role renders i3 config template
sxhkd task generates sxhkd config
input-remapper config is set
Services are reloaded to pickup changes:

sxhkd reload task
i3 config reload notification
Keybindings can now be used on the target systems.

So in summary, variables define bindings centrally, roles configure each application, and the playbook run order ensures everything is set up correctly before reloading configs.

This provides an automated, repeatable workflow to deploy desktops with consistent keybindings across many systems using Ansible.

/ask Can you explain how the keybinding configurations are rendered from templates to config files?

```
Keybinding configurations are rendered from templates to config files using Jinja templating in Ansible.

Some examples:

i3 role templates/home/.config/i3/config.j2

This is the main i3 config template. It references variables like:

{{ i3.keybindings }}
{{ i3.workspaces }}
roles/x/templates/home/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc.j2

Template for sxhkd keys, references variables like:

{{ sxhkd.keys }}
roles/sway/files/parser.py

Python script that parses Sway configs, substituting variables like:

${mod}
When playbooks run these roles:

Variables define common keybindings
Templates are rendered to target paths
Template variables are substituted
Final config files are written
This allows:

Centrally defining keys without duplicating code
Consistency across many systems
Flexibility to customize bindings per host
Automatic config generation
Jinja finds and replaces variables in templates with their defined values. This populates templates to produce customized configuration files from a common definition.
```
