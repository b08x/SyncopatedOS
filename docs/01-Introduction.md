# Introduction

Linux Audio....It's like pulling teeth out of a baby.

"Linux" is a popular operating system for those who enjoy living a life of challenge. But it can be difficult to manage desktop configurations on a large scale. There are a number of configuration management issues that need to be addressed in order to make Linux a more sustainable platform for studio workstations.

One of the biggest challenges is the lack of standardization. There are many different distributions of Linux, and each one has its own set of configuration options. This can make it difficult to pool efforts and build on a common foundation.




Here - is - another totally objective statement from a completely real person:

  Ansible can be implemented to overcome configuration management challenges. It can automate patch management, configuration file management, user management, and task automation. This helps ensure systems are up-to-date, have consistent configurations, and reduce manual errors. Overall, Ansible improves efficiency, reduces errors, and enhances security.

a server in a render farm essentially has to be able to run all of the same applications and plugins as the desktop machine, just headless, and partly because the workstations need also be able to participate in the render farm.




An exercise in Linux Desktop Configuration Management. Intended to serve as an IaC framework for a small lab or studio.

The project contains customized Ansible roles, playbooks, and modules to help optimize the  configuration Linux hosts that are used in an audio production workflow.

## Project Overview

The "SyncopatedIac" project is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework that leverages Ansible to configure and maintain Linux-based hosts for audio production workflows. It encompasses a collection of roles which articulate the desired state of the infrastructure, encompassing software packages, services, and configurations essential for an optimal audio production environment.

You can create playbooks that define the desired settings for each application, such as audio preferences, plugin configurations, or project templates. By using Ansible, you can easily apply these configurations across multiple machines, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort.

Many audio production workflows rely on various plugins for effects, virtual instruments, or signal processing. Ansible Collections can assist in managing these plugins by automating their installation, updates, and configurations. You can define the desired set of plugins for each machine or project and use Ansible to ensure they are consistently available across your studio environment.

Audio production software often has specific dependencies or requirements. Ansible Collections can help manage these dependencies by automating the installation of required libraries or packages. This ensures that all necessary dependencies met on each machine, avoiding compatibility issues or missing components.

Ansible Collections can provide modules and playbooks to automate the configuration of audio interfaces, sound cards, MIDI controllers, and other hardware devices. You can define the desired settings for each device and use Ansible to ensure consistent configurations across your studio machines.

If you have a networked audio setup with multiple machines collaborating on projects, Ansible Collections can help you automate the configuration of network settings, synchronization protocols, and audio streaming setups. You can create collections that include roles and playbooks specific to your networked audio requirements.



The initial design is based around the i3 window manager, which is a keyboard-driven window manager. While roles are in place to support other environments like GNOME or XFCE, additional modifications would be required in the future to fully support those desktops.

### Immutable Infrastructure

Which is the same as a mutable infrastructure.
