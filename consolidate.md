Excellent breakdown of your playbook tasks! Let's strategize how to consolidate roles and streamline your Ansible setup.

**Analysis**

I've carefully reviewed your task list. Here are some initial observations that will help guide our consolidation plan:

* **Audio Consolidation:** We have a clear opportunity to merge tasks from the `alsa`, `jack`, `pulseaudio`, and `pipewire` roles into a unified `audio` role.  Carefully examine potentially conflicting configurations.
* **Desktop Focus:** Combining `x` and `i3` into the `desktop` role makes sense. There's potential to use `when` conditions to handle scenarios where different window managers are in use.
* **Base Expansion:** The `zsh` and `user` roles seem like good candidates for integration into the `base` role. We'll check which user settings are universal vs. those that might remain user-specific.

**Steps for Consolidation**

Here's how we'll approach the consolidation of each role group:

**1. Audio Role Consolidation:**

*   **Review Configurations:**  Look closely at config files (.asoundrc, pulseaudio configs, JACK settings, etc.). Identify conflicts and areas for modularization.
*   **Modular Task Structure:** Break down the audio task list into sub-files using `include_tasks` or `import_tasks`. This could be based on component (e.g., `tasks/alsa.yml`, `tasks/pulseaudio.yml`, etc.).
*   **Conditional Execution:** Use `when` conditions in your consolidated `audio` role's `tasks/main.yml`, checking host variables and gathered facts  to selectively enable parts of your configuration.

**2.  Desktop Role Consolidation**

* **Variables:** Introduce a variable like `window_manager` in your inventory. Set this per host, with options like "i3", "awesomewm", etc.).
* **Config Templates:**  Update templates in `roles/desktop/templates` to use variables for WM-specific settings.
* **Tasks with 'when' Conditions:** In `desktop/tasks/main.yml`, add `when` conditions to tasks so they execute only if the active `window_manager` variable aligns.

**3. Base Role Consolidation**

* **Scope:** Decide which aspects of the `user` and `zsh` roles are genuinely universal, and should belong to every host.
* **Task Relocation:** Move the appropriate tasks directly into `roles/base/tasks/main.yml`.
* **Remaining User Settings:** Consider if any user-specific settings are better suited in individual playbooks targeting specific hosts, rather than the generic `base` role.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Inventory Updates:** Ensure you have host-specific variables for any previous role-specific settings that now need to be defined within your inventory.
* **Role Defaults Review:** Examine default settings in the `defaults/main.yml` for any roles we are combining.  Make adjustments to ensure they align with your new setup.

**Let's Start!**

**Choose an area to tackle first:** Would you like to start with the Audio consolidation, Desktop, or Base role? I'm ready to provide more specific guidance and code examples as we go.

**Also, could you share snippets of these, to get a feel for the structure?**

* A couple of tasks from one of the audio roles
* Example of an inventory host definition

This will help me provide more tailored advice!

Excellent, thanks for the additional code examples and inventory snippet!  This gives me a great foundation to offer more specific guidance on consolidating your audio role.

**Breakdown and Strategy:**

**1. Inventory Analysis:**

* **Host Groups:** We'll use your workstation group (`daw`, `dev`, `llmos`) to apply audio configurations.
* **Variables:** I notice no audio-specific variables yet. We'll introduce variables to enable/disable components:
    *   `enable_jack: True` (defaults to `True`, can be overridden per host)
    *   `enable_pipewire: False` (defaults to `False`)
    *  We might add more as we identify other component-specific settings.

**2. JACK Tasks:**

* **Conditional Execution:** Your JACK role's tasks look well-organized. We'll wrap them in a `when: enable_jack == True` condition.
* **Settings:**  Carefully examine `jack_control` settings (`driver`, `realtime`, etc.). Ensure there are no conflicts between these and any potential settings from your other audio roles.

**3. Pipewire Tasks:**

* **Conflicting Services:** If JACK is the primary audio system, the "Stop pipewire service" section should also stop and disable PulseAudio related services.  This will help prevent conflicts.
* **Package Management:**  We'll use a similar conditional approach with `when: enable_pipewire == True`.
* **Conflicting Configurations:** Since some tasks manage packages, we'll need to be mindful of conflicts. If other roles install overlapping packages, we'll need to either:
    *   Consolidate package management into the audio role itself, or
    *   Introduce more complex conditionals to check for pre-existing packages before attempting to install/remove.

**Consolidation Steps**

1. **Create New Structure:**
   * Inside `audio/tasks/`, create new files:
      * `jack.yml`
      * `pipewire.yml`
      *  Consider others like  `rtkit.yml`, `cpupower.yml` if it improves modularity.

2. **Relocate Tasks:**
   * Move tasks from your `jack` role's `tasks/main.yml` into `audio/tasks/jack.yml` under a `when: enable_jack == True` condition.
   * Do the same for the Pipewire tasks (`audio/tasks/pipewire.yml`) with `when: enable_pipewire == True`.

3. **Main Task File (audio/tasks/main.yml):**

   ```yaml
   ---
   - import_tasks: rtkit.yml  # Example -  include your real-time/CPU tasks
   - import_tasks: jack.yml
   - import_tasks: pipewire.yml
   # ... other imports as needed
    ```

**Inventory Update Example (for a host named 'daw'):**

```yaml
[workstation:children]
daw
dev
llmos

[daw]
enable_jack: True
enable_pipewire: False  # Optional, since 'False' is the default
```

**Let's Start Consolidating!**

Let's begin by:

1. **Relocating Tasks:** Move your JACK and Pipewire tasks into the new structure as described above.
2. **Adding Conditionals:**  Add the `when` conditions to the top of each included task file.

Let me know when you have this set up, and I'll help with the next steps, including:

*   Addressing potential conflicts
*   Introducing more variables.
*   Testing the changes
