# base

Here are some more details on the structure and contents of the base role:

The role is located at /syncopatedIaC/roles/base

It contains various files and subdirectories:

README.md - Documentation for the role

defaults/ - Default variables

files/ - Static files used by tasks

handlers/ - Handler definitions

meta/ - Role metadata like dependencies

tasks/ - Main task files like main.yml

templates/ - Template files used by tasks

tests/ - Role test files

vars/ - Variables specific to the base role

Main tasks are broken out into separate YAML files for each subdomain, included from tasks/main.yml. This modularity helps organize the role.

Some example task files included are:

roles/base/tasks/sudoers.yml
roles/base/tasks/repos.yml
roles/base/tasks/xdg.yml
roles/base/tasks/sshd.yml
It performs fundamental system configuration like package/service management, OS properties, bootloader etc.

Configures environment variables, directories, default configurations.

Performs upgrades, enables basic services across all managed hosts.

Supports other roles by handling common prerequisites and configuration needs.

So in summary, it provides a well structured, modular role to establish core OS configuration as a foundation for other roles.

---

The main tasks performed by the base role include:

Ensuring root directories exist that will be used by other roles.

Configuring environment variables and default paths according to the XDG Base Directory spec. This includes things like $HOME/.config, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, etc.

Configuring SSH daemon settings like PermitRootLogin.

Installing SSH keys and known_hosts files.

Configuring passwordless sudo and Sudoers rules for the automation user.

Managing package repositories - adds required repos, imports keys.

Updating all packages to latest versions.

Installing basic utility packages like vim, traceroute, etc.

Configuring the package manager config - apt sources.list, pacman.conf, etc.

Managing the Linux kernel, building initramfs images.

Configuring the bootloader (GRUB).

Installing basic services like autofs for automounting.

Deploying common scripts and utilities to all hosts.

So in summary, it handles fundamental OS configuration and enables basic functionality that is reused across all other roles for a standardized environment. This establishes a common baseline.

Key files involved are roles/base/tasks/main.yml and the included task files for each subdomain.

---

The base role in Ansible is important as it handles fundamental configuration that is common across all or most systems. Some key things it does:

Installs packages required for basic system functionality and Ansible operation. This ensures all hosts have a common set of utilities.

Configures core OS settings like timezone, locale, keyboard, hostname, etc.

Manages package repositories - adds required repos for software installation.

Configures passwordless sudo for automation user.

Configures SSH - parameters like PermitRootLogin, ListenAddress.

Manages firewall rules, securing services like cron.

Updates all packages on first run to latest versions.

Configures basic directories, symlinks and default files.

Handles reboots if needed for changes like SELinux configuration.

Installs utilities packages - vim, zip, traceroute, etc.

Configures package managers - pacman.conf, apt sources list, dnf repos, etc.

Manages filesystem directories for logs, cache indexes etc.

Configures services - autofs, timesyncd, zram swap storage.

So in summary, it establishes core OS configuration and enables basic functionality as a foundation for other more specialized roles to build upon. This ensures a common baseline across all hosts.

The meta file also documents role metadata like author, dependencies, supported platforms, tags etc. And the README provides usage instructions.
