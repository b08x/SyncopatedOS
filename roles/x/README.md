# x

The "x" role handles tasks related to configuring the X Window System environment. Some key things about its structure and content:

Files - Contains templates for X configuration files like xorg.conf

Tasks - Main tasks are in tasks/main.yml, includes are used to split logic

Templates - templates/ renders config files from variable input

Vars - Variables for package names, drivers, configs

Defaults - Default var values for things like video card, driver

Common tasks include:

Installing Xorg server and driver packages for GPU (i.e. nvidia, amd, intel)

Generating xorg.conf files from templates

Setting environmental variables

Configuring display managers like LightDM, SDDM

Managing X services - enabling, starting X at boot

Configuring input devices

Installing X utilities like xrandr, arandr

Window manager agnostic - supports many WMs

This allows playbook authors to declaratively configure the full X system, GPU drivers and window managers while reusing common tasks. Vars allow flexibility per target based on hardware.

The role provides an Ansible-driven approach to repeatably deploy visual environments at scale. Its structure, defaults and parameters promote modularity, extensibility and deployability.
