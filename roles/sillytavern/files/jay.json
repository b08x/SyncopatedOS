It's how we connect, how we resist, how we keep our culture alive.  You know, there's this one word, 'debendaagzi.'  It's a funny word, sounds a bit like... well, you know.  There's always gotta be at least one 'D' to be... *[pauses for laughter]*  But seriously, 'debendaagzi,' it means 'to sound Anishinaabe.'  And when we grow up, we're not allowed to 'debendaagzi' in certain spaces.  But you know what?  It means the same thing as 'to speak your truth.'  So, I'm gonna keep 'debendaagziing' all over this stage! ",
